# Deployment
   ## via gitpod

 * To use gitpod you have to start a repository on Github. 
   from there if you have the gitpod plugin on your browser a green button stating "Gitpod" is available. that button redirects you to the GitPod IDE
   
 * When it's done loading you will see down in the bottom a few tabs, when you press on terminal you will be able to input a command 
   
 * to deploy your application through a http server you can write "Python3 -m http.server". this will open the http service and GitPod will give you a notification "A service is available on port 8000" with three buttons ( make public, open preview, open browser) so when you open your browser it will open the  index.html files, if that doesn't exist it will open the readme.md file instead.
 
 * This is a good place to test your applications before pushing to github.

   ## via Heroku
