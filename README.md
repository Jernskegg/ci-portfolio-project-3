# Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to make a Battleship game in Python.

# User Stories

as a user I want to play a game of logic.

*
   
# Technology

  ## python
  Python is a easy and basic programming language, but it is powerfull with the use libraries to bring out capabilities to use in multiple applications of use.

  ## google spreadsheet
  Google speadsheets is a calculus applications offered by google where you can make speadsheets, charts and advanced caluclations

  in this project Googlespeadsheet is used for the battlemaps, There is probably a better way but I want to incorperate the spreadsheet for the manipulation of a realworld situation where python would need a spreadsheet to manipulate.

# testing

   ## code validation
   
   ## test cases (user story based with screenshots)
  
   ## fixed bugs and issues found.

# Deployment
   ## via gitpod

 * To use gitpod you have to start a repository on Github. 
   from there if you have the gitpod plugin on your browser a green button stating "Gitpod" is available. that button redirects you to the GitPod IDE
   
 * When it's done loading you will see down in the bottom a few tabs, when you press on terminal you will be able to input a command 
   
 * to deploy your application through a http server you can write "Python3 -m http.server". this will open the http service and GitPod will give you a notification "A service is available on port 8000" with three buttons ( make public, open preview, open browser) so when you open your browser it will open the  index.html files, if that doesn't exist it will open the readme.md file instead.
 
 * This is a good place to test your applications before pushing to github.

   ## via Heroku
